\item Consider a unity-gain negative feedback system consisting of the plant $G\brak{s}$  and a proportional-integral controller. Let the proportional gain and integral
gain be 3 and 1, respectively. For a unit step reference input, the final values of the
controller output and the plant output, respectively, are
\begin{align}
    G\brak{s} = \frac{1}{\brak{s-1}} \notag
\end{align}

\item Level \brak{h} in a steam boiler is controlled by manipulating the flow rate \brak{F} of the break-up(fresh) water using a proportional \brak{P} controller. The transfer function between the output and the manipulated input is   \\
$$ \frac{h\brak{s}}{F\brak{s}}=\frac{0.25\brak{1-s}}{s\brak{2s+1}} $$   \\
The measurement and the valve transfer functions are both equal to 1. A process engineer wants to tune the controller so that the closed loop response gives the decaying oscillations under the servo mode. Which one of the following is the CORRECT value of the controller gain to be used by the engineer? \\
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $0.25$
    \item $2$
    \item $4$
    \item $6$
